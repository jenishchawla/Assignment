Q-2 What is a Bootstrap container, and how does it work?
Ans: - A Bootstrap container is a fundamental layout element in the Bootstrap framework. 
It is a wrapper that contains and centre’s the content of a web page, limiting the maximum 
width of the content to a specific value, depending on the screen size. The container class is 
used to create a responsive container element that adjusts to the width of the user's device.
 Bootstrap provides three types of containers: container, container-fluid, and 
container-sm, container-md, container-lg, container-xl, and container-xxl.
 The container class creates a responsive fixed-width container that is centered on 
the page. The width of the container is determined by the screen size, and it is 
designed to be used for small to medium-sized screens.
 The container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of 
the viewport. It is designed to be used for large screens and provides a flexible 
layout.
 The container-sm, container-md, container-lg, container-xl, and container-xxl classes 
allow you to specify different container widths for different screen sizes, providing 
more precise control over the layout of your content.
