JAVASCRIPT BASIC & DOM 
  
 1)What is JavaScript?  
  
 JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. 
  
 JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. 
  
 JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data. 
  
  
  
  
 2) What is the use of isNaN function?  
 The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number. Because coercion inside the isNaN() function can be surprising, you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN(). 
  
 <!-- isNaN("37.37"); covert string to number use "isnan()" --> 
  
  
  
  
 3) What is negative Infinity?  
  JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity . This value behaves mathematically like infinity; for example, anything multiplied by infinity is infinity, and anything divided by infinity is zero. In ECMAScript v1 and later, you can also use -Infinity instead of Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY . 
  
  
  
  
 4) Which company developed JavaScript?  
  
 "Netscape" and "Eich" designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. 
  
  
 5)  What are undeclared and undefined variables?  
     ====>  var x ; 
            console.log("x") 
            <!-- here x   is undeclared  here error show becouse values not set--> 
  
    ====> console.log("y") 
    <!-- here result is error y is undefined , becouse not var ,let,const set value--> 
  
  
  
  
 6)  Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

       </h1> 
  
       <div id="innerdiv"></div> 
  
       <button id="mybutton">

             document.getElementById("innerdiv").innerHTML += "<h3>Hello User</h3><p>Start your learning journey today.</p>"; 
          }); 
       </script> 
    </body> 
    </html> --> 
  
 7)  What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? 
  
 - A ViewState is a state of a page within a browser wherein the values of controls persist when post back operation is done.

    fs.writeFile('tp.txt', fInput, (err) => { 
    if (err) throw err; 
    else{ 
       console.log("The file is updated with the given data") 
    } 
  }) 
  
  
  2)readFile(path, format, callBackFunc)
