                Sundar Pichai, in full Pichai Sundararajan, (born June 10, 1972, Madras [now Chennai],<b> Tamil Nadu</b>, India), Indian-born American executive who was<b> CEO</b> of both<b> Google, Inc.</b> (2015), and its holding company, Alphabet Inc. (2019).

                As a boy growing up in<b> Madras</b>, Pichai slept with his brother in the living room of the cramped family home, but his father, an electrical engineer at the British multinational GEC, saw that the boys received a good education. At an early age Pichai displayed an interest in technology and an extraordinary memory, especially for telephone numbers. After earning a degree in metallurgy (B.Tech., 1993) and a silver medal at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, he was awarded a scholarship to study at<b> Stanford University</b> (M.S. in engineering and<b> materials science</b>, 1995). He remained in the<b> United States</b> thereafter, working briefly for Applied Materials (a supplier of semiconductor materials) and then earning an M.B.A. (2002) from the Wharton School of the<b> University of Pennsylvania</b>.

                Following a short<b> stint</b> at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., Pichai joined <b>Google</b> in 2004 as the head of product management and development. He initially worked on the Google Toolbar, which enabled those using the Microsoft<b> Internet Explorer</b> and Mozilla<b> Firefox</b> Web<b> browsers</b> to easily access the Google<b> search engine</b>. Over the next few years, he was directly involved in the development of Google’s own browser,<b> Chrome</b>, which was released to the public in 2008. That same year Pichai was named vice president of product development, and he began to take a more-active public role. By 2012 he was a senior vice president, and two years later he was made product chief over both Google and the<b> Android smartphone operating system.</b>

                In 2011 Pichai reportedly was aggressively pursued for employment by microblogging service<b> Twitter</b>, and in 2014 he was<b> touted</b> as a possible CEO for<b> Microsoft</b>, but in both instances he was granted large financial packages to remain with Google. He also was known to have helped negotiate Google’s $3.2 billion deal to acquire Nest Labs in 2014. Therefore, when Google cofounders<b> Larry Page</b> and<b> Sergey Brin</b> announced the creation of Alphabet Inc., in August 2015, it came as no surprise to industry insiders that Pichai was named CEO of Google, which was reorganized as a subsidiary. In December 2019 he also was named CEO of<b> Alphabet</b>, replacing Page, who stepped down.
